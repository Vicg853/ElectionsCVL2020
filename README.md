### Elections CVL Lyc√©e Pasteur
This project was a voting system webpage for my school. The idea was to make a voting website, where people would be able to vote on the candidates for the student council...
In summary, the system worked with the verification of students registration I.D. given by the school for each one of them, that were both unique and private. The next step was to chose the candidate and finaly finish the voting.
